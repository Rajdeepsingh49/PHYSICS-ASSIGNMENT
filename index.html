    In the world of mechanics, 
    there are 
    four basic types of motion. 
    These four are rotary, 
    oscillating, linear and
     reciprocating. 
    Each one moves 
    In a slightly different way and each 
    type of achieved using different mechanical 
    means that help us understand linear motion 
    and motion control. </h4>

    A force is a push or pull acting upon 
    an object as a result of its interaction with 
    another object. There are a variety of types of forces. Previously in 
    this lesson, a variety of force types were placed into two broad category
    headings on the basis of whether the force resulted from 
    the contact or non-contact of the two interacting objects. </h4>

 <h3 class="T">SPEED AND VELOCITY</h3>
 <div class="item">

  <h4 class="imagetext">
    Speed is the time rate at which an object is moving along a path,
    while velocity is the rate and direction of an object's movement.
    Put another way, speed is a scalar value, while velocity is a
     vector. </h4>
